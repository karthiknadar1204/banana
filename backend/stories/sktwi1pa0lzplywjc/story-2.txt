Europe's inflation may spike due to the Olympics and Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, but UBS says locals won't feel the pinch. Mega events like these create sudden demand shocks, boosting prices in industries like hotels and airlines. However, the impact on the local cost of living is minimal. The Paris Olympics has seen a surge in hotel occupancy and prices, but most French consumers remain unaffected. The long-term economic impact of the Games is expected to be positive, potentially generating up to $12 billion.
