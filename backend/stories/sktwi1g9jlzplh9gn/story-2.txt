Taylor Swiftâ€™s Eras Tour boosted hotel revenue in cities across the U.S. and U.K. hotel prices increased in June due to her concerts. The Summer Games are causing a similar phenomenon in Paris. Tourists flocking to Paris for the Olympics are not representative of French consumers. Paris hotel occupancy levels during the Olympics are up versus last year, with massive year-over-year price increases. The Paris tourist office expects an occupancy rate of 86% from Aug. 5 through Sunday. A notable price surge has also been seen in other parts of France.
