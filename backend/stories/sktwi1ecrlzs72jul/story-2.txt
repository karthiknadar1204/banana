Two key inflation reports are due this week, with the first, producer price index, due on Tuesday. The PPI is expected to reflect a 0.2% increase in July, which would be in line with Juneâ€™s reading, according to a Dow Jones consensus estimate. The wholesale inflation figures will be followed by the consumer price index on Wednesday.
